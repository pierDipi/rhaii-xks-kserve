              InferenceModelSpec represents the desired state of a specific model use case. This resource is
              managed by the "Inference Workload Owner" persona.

              The Inference Workload Owner persona is someone that trains, verifies, and
              leverages a large language model from a model frontend, drives the lifecycle
              and rollout of new versions of those models, and defines the specific
              performance and latency goals for the model. These workloads are
              expected to operate within an InferencePool sharing compute capacity with other
              InferenceModels, defined by the Inference Platform Admin.

              InferenceModel's modelName (not the ObjectMeta name) is unique for a given InferencePool,
              if the name is reused, an error will be shown on the status of a
              InferenceModel that attempted to reuse. The oldest InferenceModel, based on
              creation timestamp, will be selected to remain valid. In the event of a race
              condition, one will be selected at random.

                  Criticality impacts how traffic is handled in resource constrained situations. It handles this by
                  queuing or rejecting requests of lower criticality. InferenceModels of an equivalent Criticality will
                  fairly share resources over throughput of tokens. In the future, the metric used to calculate fairness,
                  and the proportionality of fairness will be configurable.

                  (names can be reused for a different pool in the same cluster).

                  InferenceModel's Ready status is set to false with a corresponding reason.

                  Names can be reserved without an underlying model configured in the pool.

                        sent to this model when multiple target models are specified.

                        Weight defines the proportion of requests forwarded to the specified
                        model. This is computed as weight/(sum of all weights in this

                        the exact proportion defined here depending on the precision an
                        implementation supports. Weight is not a percentage and the sum of
                        weights does not need to equal 100.

                  Priority is an integer value that defines the priority of the request.
                  The higher the value, the more critical the request is; negative values _are_ allowed.
                  No default value is set for this field, allowing for future additions of new fields that may 'one of' with this field.
                  However, implementations that consume this field (such as the Endpoint Picker) will treat an unset value as '0'.
                  Priority is used in flow control, primarily in the event of resource scarcity(requests need to be queued).
                  All requests will be queued, and flow control will _always_ allow requests of higher priority to be served first.
                  Fairness is only enforced and tracked between requests of the same priority.

                  Example: requests with Priority 10 will always be served before
                  requests with Priority of 0 (the value used if Priority is unset or no InfereneceObjective is specified).
                  Similarly requests with a Priority of -10 will always be served after requests with Priority of 0.
